    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!-- not sure if using <br> is a good idea, need to search more on how to make clean breaks -->
    <p>I’m a Computer Science, Mathematics, and Data Science student passionate about building technology that empowers underserved communities.</p><br>
    <p>I’ve worked across nonprofit and community initiatives, from digital literacy and STEM education to development and empowerment programs for women and children, including projects in Cambodia, Tanzania, and South Africa. These experiences drive my interest in designing technology that is ethical, inclusive, and grounded in real human needs.</p><br>
    <p>My interests live at the intersection of AI/ML, data, sustainability, human-centered interaction, and inclusive design. I care deeply about how technology is built and who it serves, and I explore ways it can be designed thoughtfully to create real, lasting social impact. Through mentoring, research, and community-driven projects, I aim to build systems that are not just innovative but genuinely equitable.</p><br>
    <p>I’m excited to keep learning and growing as a technologist and researcher, and I’m always looking to collaborate with people and organizations that value ethics, inclusion, and meaningful real-world impact.</p><br>
